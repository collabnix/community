## Getting Familiar with Bevy Virtual

Docker community leaders uses Bevy (https://events.docker.com) tool to conduct virtual Meetup events. Bevy is the tool that provides the MOST features to your Community, including:

- 2 way integration with Meetup.com (create your event in Bevy and it posts to your meetup page and RSVPs from your event on meetup sync with your Bevy events.docker.com page).
Note: The RSVP limits you set in Bevy do not translate to meetup. The best way to handle this is to keep a watchful eye on both platforms or communicate that seats are first come first serve. 

- Ability to check in guests.
- Mobile App
- RSVP as Guest
- Forms / Surveys
- Automatic Emails (customizable) 

It's important for all community leaders to be familiar with this tool to conduct virtual events successfully.
