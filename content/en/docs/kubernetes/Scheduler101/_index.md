## What is Kubernetes Scheduling?

- The Kubernetes Scheduler is a core component of Kubernetes: After a user or a controller creates a Pod, the Kubernetes Scheduler, monitoring the Object Store for unassigned Pods, will assign the Pod to a Node. Then, the Kubelet, monitoring the Object Store for assigned Pods, will execute the Pod.

## what is the scheduler for?

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/collabnix/dockerlabs/master/kubernetes/workshop/Scheduler101/schedulerhow.png)

The Kubernetes scheduler is in charge of scheduling pods onto nodes. Basically it works like this:

   1. You create a pod
   2. The scheduler notices that the new pod you created doesn’t have a node assigned to it
   3. The scheduler assigns a node to the pod

It’s not responsible for actually running the pod – that’s the kubelet’s job. So it basically just needs to make sure every pod has a node assigned to it. Easy, right?

Kubernetes in general has this idea of a “controller”. A controller’s job is to:

  - look at the state of the system
  - notice ways in which the actual state does not match the desired state (like “this pod needs to be assigned a node”)
  - repeat

The scheduler is a kind of controller. There are lots of different controllers and they all have different jobs and operate independently.


## How Kubernetes Selects The Right node?


# What is node affinity ?

- In simple words this  allows you to tell Kubernetes to schedule pods only to specific subsets of nodes.
- The initial node affinity mechanism in early versions of Kubernetes was the nodeSelector field in the pod specification. The node had to include all the labels specified in that field to be eligible to become the target for the pod.
## nodeSelector
## Steps
```
$ kubectl label nodes node2 mynode=worker-1
$ kubectl apply -f pod-nginx.yaml
```

- We have label on the node with node name,in this case i have given node2 as mynode=worker-1 label. 

## Viewing Your Pods

$ kubectl get pods --output=wide

```
- You can check in above output  Node-Selectors:  mynode=worker-1

## Deleting the Pod
```
$ kubectl delete -f pod-nginx.yaml
pod "nginx" deleted
```


# Node affinity

- Node affinity is conceptually similar to nodeSelector – it allows you to constrain which nodes your pod is eligible to be scheduled on, based on labels on the node.

- There are currently two types of node affinity.
1. requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution  (Preferred during scheduling, ignored during execution; we are also known as "hard" requirements)
2. preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution  (Required during scheduling, ignored during execution; we are also known as "soft" requirements)

## Steps
```
$ kubectl label nodes node2 mynode=worker-1
$ kubectl label nodes node3 mynode=worker-3
$ kubectl apply -f pod-with-node-affinity.yaml
```

## Step  Cleanup

Finally you can clean up the resources you created in your cluster:
```
$ kubectl delete -f pod-with-node-affinity.yaml
```

# Anti-Node Affinity ?

- Some scenarios require that you don’t use one or more nodes except for particular pods. Think of the nodes that host your monitoring application.
- Those nodes shouldn’t have many resources due to the nature of their role. Thus, if other pods than those which have the monitoring app are scheduled to those nodes, they hurt monitoring and also degrades the application they are hosting.
- In such a case, you need to use node anti-affinity to keep pods away from a set of nodes.

## Steps
```
$ kubectl label nodes node2 mynode=worker-1
$ kubectl label nodes node3 mynode=worker-3
$ kubectl apply -f pod-anti-node-affinity.yaml
```

- Adding another key to the matchExpressions with the operator NotIn will avoid scheduling the nginx pods on any node labelled worker-1.


## Step  Cleanup

Finally you can clean up the resources you created in your cluster:
```
$ kubectl delete -f pod-anti-node-affinity.yaml
```

# What is Node taints and tolerations ?

- This Kubernetes feature allows users to mark a node (taint the node) so that no pods can be scheduled to it, unless a pod explicitly tolerates the taint.
- When you taint a node, it is automatically excluded from pod scheduling. When the schedule runs the predicate tests on a tainted node, they’ll fail unless the pod has toleration for that node. 

- Like last monitoring example: Let assume  new member joins the development team, writes a Deployment for her application, but forgets to exclude the monitoring nodes from the target nodes? Kubernetes administrators need a way to repel pods from nodes without having to modify every pod definition. 

## Steps
```
$ kubectl label nodes node2 role=dev
$ kubectl label nodes node3 role=dev

$ kubectl taint nodes node2 role=dev:NoSchedule
node/node2 tainted
$ kubectl apply -f pod-taint-node.yaml
```

## Step  Cleanup

Finally you can clean up the resources you created in your cluster:

```

## Tolerations 

- A toleration is a way of ignoring a taint during scheduling. Tolerations aren’t applied to nodes, but rather the pods. So, in the example above, if we apply a toleration to the PodSpec, we could “tolerate” the slow disks on that node and still use it.

## Steps
```
$ kubectl apply -f pod-tolerations-node.yaml
```

```


## Step  Cleanup

Finally you can clean up the resources you created in your cluster:
```
$ kubectl delete -f pod-tolerations-node.yaml
```

- An important thing to notice, though, is that tolerations may enable a tainted node to accept a pod but it does not guarantee that this pod runs on that specific node.
- In other words, the tainted node  will be considered as one of the candidates for running our pod. However, if another node has a higher priority score, it will be chosen instead. For situations like this, you need to combine the toleration with nodeSelector or node affinity parameters.
