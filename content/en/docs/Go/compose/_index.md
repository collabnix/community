The app fetches the quote of the day from a public API hosted at http://quotes.rest then it caches the result in Redis. For subsequent API calls, the app will return the result from Redis cache instead of fetching it from the public API

 create following file structure :
 
 ```
 go-docker-compose
	↳ model
		↳ quote.go
	↳ app.go
 
 
 ```
 
 

# Run Go application 

```
git clone https://github.com/docker-community-leaders/dockercommunity/
cd /content/en/examples/Golang/go-docker-compose
go mod init https://github.com/docker-community-leaders/dockercommunity/content/en/examples/Golang/go-docker-compose
go build
```
# Run binaries 

```
$ ./go-docker-compose

The free soul is rare, but you know it when you see it - basically because you feel good, very good, when you are near or with them.

```

# Dockerize above go application 




# application;s services via Docker Compose 

Our application consists of two services -

- App service that contains the API to display the “quote of the day”.
- Redis which is used by the app to cache the “quote of the day”.

Let’s define both the services in a `docker-compose.yml` file 

 
 # Running the application with docker compose

```
$ docker-compose up
Starting go-docker-compose_redis_1 ... done
Starting go-docker-compose_app_1   ... done
Attaching to go-docker-compose_redis_1, go-docker-compose_app_1

Redis must be restarted after THP is disabled.

```

The docker-compose up command starts all the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file. 
You can interact with the Go service using curl -

```
$ curl http://localhost:8080/qod
A show of confidence raises the bar

```

# Stopping all the services with docker compose

```
$ docker-compose down

```
